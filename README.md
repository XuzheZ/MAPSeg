# MAPSeg
MAPSeg: Unified Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Heterogeneous Medical Image Segmentation Based on 3D Masked Autoencoding and Pseudo-Labeling

:beers: Accepted @ CVPR 2024! We are refining the code to be released and aim to upload it by the <ins>end of April</ins>.

We are currently:
- Merging code of centralized/federated/test-time UDA into the same codespace. 
- Improving the configuration module to give more control over augmentation and hyperparameters in the yaml file instead of making it hard-coded. 
- Testing on some other tasks to ensure the code is usable out-of-box. 

We have some exciting news regarding MAPSeg's extension applications (beyond cardiac and brain), stay tuned!
